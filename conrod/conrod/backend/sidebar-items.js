This is supported by all GPUs and easy to implement in shader languages.Default trait methods can be overridden for better performance or higher quality.When drawing, use this trait as generic constraint:Color space is sRGB.Notice for back-end authorsWhen sRGB is enabled for a back-end shader, the gamma must be converted to linear space when used as vertex color or uniform parameter. To convert gamma, use `color::gamma_srgb_to_linear`.For more information, see https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston/issues/1014."]]});
