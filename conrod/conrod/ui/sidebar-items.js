initSidebarItems({"struct":[["Ui","`Ui` is the most important type within Conrod and is necessary for rendering and maintaining widget state.Ui Handles the following:Contains the state of all widgets which can be indexed via their widget::Index. Stores rendering state for each widget until the end of each render cycle. Contains the theme used for default styling of the widgets. Maintains the latest user input state (for mouse and keyboard). Maintains the latest window dimensions."],["UiCell","A wrapper around the `Ui` that restricts the user from mutating the `Ui` in certain ways while in the scope of the `Ui::set_widgets` function and within `Widget`s' `update` methods. Using the `UiCell`, users may access the `Ui` immutably (via `Deref`) however they wish, however they may only mutate the `Ui` via the `&mut self` methods provided by the `UiCell`.The name came from its likening to a \"jail cell for the `Ui`\", as it restricts a user's access to it. However, we realise that the name may also cause ambiguity with the std `Cell` and `RefCell` types (which `UiCell` has nothing to do with). Thus, if you have a better name for this type in mind, please let us know at the github repo via an issue or PR sometime before we hit 1.0.0!"],["UserInput","A wrapper over the current user input state.NOTE: This is deprecated in favour of the new `events` API introduced in PR #684 and will be removed once all internal widgets have been ported over to the new API."]]});
